## Project Overview
In the event of a disaster, evacuation alerts are issued but rely solely on sound, becoming ineffectual for those with deaf and hard of hearing, highlighting a critical social inequality. Neuroplasticity suggests that individuals with hearing loss often have enhanced visual capabilities, making visual alarms a preferred method for alerts, as indicated by research in the *Fire Technology journal's* "Alarm Technologies to Wake Sleeping People Who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (2022)." This underscores the necessity for a visual warning system.
